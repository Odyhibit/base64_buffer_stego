# Base64 buffer bit encoding

This script takes a serires of base64 encoded strings, and recovers the buffer bits(left over after 8 bit bytes are created). It takes a bunch since there are only a few bits per base64 encoded string.
You can try it out on this webpage if you don't want to download the Python.
